      <description>MHK2 is one of the challenges I coauthored for Google CTF 2023 and there were 18 teams solving this challenge during the contest time.
Challenge Summary This challenge implements the knapsack cryptosystem from Y. Murakami, S. Hamasho and M. Kasahara&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;A knapsack public-key cryptosystem using two random sequences&amp;rdquo;. Below summarizes how a keypair is generated and how a bit is being encrypted:
Generating a keypair  For $i = 1, 2$:  Generate a random sequence $\textbf{s}_i = (s_{i, 1}, s_{i, 2}, &amp;hellip;, s_{i, 256})$ where $0 \leq s_{ij} &amp;lt; 2^{128}$.</description>

      <description>Asian Cyber Security Challenge (ACSC) is an annual CTF where players are competing individually, and the best young Asians will be selected form a team to represent Asia to compete with others. I ended up winning the competition among 450+ players. Unfortunately, I am unable to qualify because of the age and nationality conditions.
In this blog post, I will cover two web challenges, @t0nk42&amp;rsquo;s easySSTI (43 solves) and @tyage&amp;rsquo;s Gotion (9 solves).</description>

      <description>idekCTF 2022* definitely has a fun and inspiring set of cryptography challenges. I played with @blackb6a and we solved 8 of the 10 crypto challenges.
In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll include my solution on three of them: Primonumerophobia (10 solves), Chronophobia (5 solves) and Decidophobia (3 solves).
Primonumerophobia Challenge Summary Let $T = \{0, 4, 6, 10, 16, 18, 24, 28, 30, 34, 36, 40, 42, 44, 45\}$. An initial state $(t_0, t_1, &amp;hellip;, t_{46})$ with $t_0, t_1, &amp;hellip;, t_{46} \in \{0, 1\}$ is generated and define</description>

      <description>I prepared three challenges on behalf of @blackb6a for MOCSCTF, which is a 8-hour long CTF happened yesterday. This blogpost serves as the write-up for the three challenges that I wrote.
There are two solves (out of 40 participants) for Three-pass, and zero solves for jav-asr-ipt and Catch-22 Mini.
Three-pass Challenge Summary  Shamir is a famous cryptographer. He invented the three-pass protocol, so I don&amp;rsquo;t see it is unsafe.</description>

      <description>Like in 2021 and 2022, I contributed some challenges for Firebird&amp;rsquo;s internal CTF, which are from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. This time I wrote three crypto challenges: Randomsum, Shelter and Threerider.
There were 24 teams participating. There were three solves for Randomsum, while Shelter and Threerider were unsolved during the CTF.
üéâ Thank you! Kudos to @LifeIsHard for reading the write-up and giving me comments (including those erratas) so that I could improve the blog post!</description>

      <description>üí≠ Is this technical? No. If you are looking for CTF writeups, this is not what you are interested. Instead, this is just me talking on my 2022.  2022 is a life-changer for me. There were some tough decisions and a few surprises.
Leaving Hong Kong   The #1 difference for me is I moved from Hong Kong üá≠üá∞ to Taiwan üáπüáº. The most obvious reason is to commence my new career at Google, which I think was an opportunity as well.</description>

      <description>This is the third year Black Bauhinia co-organized HKCERT CTF. This time I wrote nine challenges: Seven crypto, one reverse and one misc.
Similar to the last year, I have a series of three blog posts walking through the challenges that I wrote. We will discuss the four easier crypto challenges: Flawed ElGamal, Catch-22, Rogue Secret Assistant and Base64 encryption.
This is an index of the challenges I wrote for HKCERT CTF 2022.</description>

      <description>HACKING GOOGLE is a documentary of Google&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity teams and H4CK1NG G00GL3 is it&amp;rsquo;s CTF counterpart. Project Zero Adventure is a cryptography challenge I wrote.
In the game, the players control the Security Princess to dodge the obstacles and catch the bugs (a variant of Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s dinosaur game). After that, the server will sign messages consisting of the players&#39; name and the score via the /sign API. The players will then submit it to the /highscore API.</description>

      <description>Credits. Thumbnail credit goes to Quasar! üéâ  vss is an interesting crypto challenge in BalsnCTF, which ended up having 9 solves. I took around 2.5 hours to solve the challenge. This challenge reminds me the yet another PRNG challenge from pbctf 2021 (challenge description, writeup written by @maple3142 and @rkm0959), but with a setting which looked harder. I was pretty surprised that LLL worked, too.
lfsr is another crypto challenge in BalsnCTF with 6 solvers.</description>

      <description>This is the third year I had a writeup on Google CTF (see my writeup in 2020 and 2021). Yet this time it is the official writeup for a challenge - as the challenge author! There are eventually 35 solvers (out of 382 teams) for the challenge.
Challenge Summary We are given a public key of Paillier cryptosystem $(n, g)$, and is asked to complete 16 rounds of challenge $\mathcal{C}$. In each round of $\mathcal{C}$:</description>

      <description>Signature is a crypto challenge from TSJ CTF 2022, which ended up having two solves. From this challenge, we can see how ECDSA private keys can be recovered by having a (weak) deterministic ephemeral key, $k$.
Challenge Summary Suppose that $d$ is the private key for ECDSA (over curve secp256k1). We are given six signatures signed with the above private key. However, $k$ is computed by $k = d \oplus z$ ($z$ is the hash of the message) rather than generated randomly.</description>

      <description>Credits. I stole the banner image from TSJ CTF. Thanks!  @blackb6a played TSJ CTF and CODEGATE CTF this weekend. Both of the CTFs had a bunch of epic (and hard-ish) crypto challenges, which made our head scratched for days.
We were two points behind @balsnctf few minutes before the game ends and I found one more flag. It is proud to tell that we won TSJ CTF üéâ!
Anyway, I will compile writeups for (at least) three challenges for TSJ CTF, namely Cipher Switching Service, Signature and Genie.</description>

      <description>@blackb6a helped preparing some challenges for MOCSCTF, a 8.5-hour long CTF in Macau. This time I wrote nine challenges and @hoifanrd made one of them (3-AES). This blog post covers the intended solution for all of them.
These are the summary of the challenges:
   Challenge Name Category Solves     RSA Trio Crypto 2/43   Slightly Informative Crypto 2/43   NP-SHA256 Crypto 1/43   HMAC-SHA256 Crypto 2/43   RC4 Crypto 0/43   HashTable Misc 3/43   Wordle Crypto, Misc 0/43   3-AES Crypto, Misc 0/43   Elementary Reverse 0/43   Redactor Reverse 1/43    RSA Trio (Crypto) Challenge Summary When connected to the server, three 1024-bit primes $p$, $q$ and $r$ are generated.</description>

      <description>This is another round of @intigriti&#39;s XSS challenge, and this time it is written by @aszx87410. I spent around four hours solving it.
Challenge Summary We are given a form that allows us a create a character. We are allowed to
 choose a name (shorter than 24 characters), and inform if we have played the game.  We will be redirected to /challenge/xss.html?q=mystiz&amp;amp;first=yes (if you are mystiz who is not a first-timer to the game).</description>

Deja vu? I said similar things last year. Until now, part 2 of my writeup series on DiceCTF 2021 does not exist.  I will first cover on a crypto challenge called commitment-issues, which had 16 solves (out of 1127 participating teams).</description>

What are the stars? They are the difficulties I estimated when comparing to global CTFs (where I documented them here since Q3 last year).  Lack of Entropy (Crypto) Three (out of six) teams solved this during the CTF.</description>

      <description>Black Bauhinia coorganized HKCERT CTF 2021 and helped 95% of the technical stuffs, including challenge setting, platform development, infrastructure and etc. I will be writing a series of blog posts talking about the contest, and the first four would be the writeups of the challenges those I wrote.
In the first blog post, we will be going through four easier crypto challenges: A Joke Cipher, Cipher Mode Picker, Key Backup Service 1 and Key Backup Service 2.</description>

      <description>No, we did not win. I see that coming and took a screenshot during the game.
BSides Ahmedabad CTF 2021 is organized by @zer0pts. That implies that players could spend a day happily working on the challenges. I enjoyed working on the challenges a lot. I&#39;ll go through the harder crypto challenges and the reversing challenge called Collapsed License in this blog post.

      <description>LagLeg is a crypto challenge in ASIS CTF Quals 2021. We are asked to factor a given $n$ with $n = (r^5 + s)(r + s)$ as part of the challenge. Hereby $r$ and $s$ are respectively 256 and 64 bits long. I think my approach used is very unique and creative - and definitely worth mentioning. It does not mean that it is a good approach, however.
I will record the exact steps I solved the challenge.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the thumbnail? I sent it to rbtree after I sent him my solution on Yet Another PRNG and he responded &amp;ldquo;oh this works?&amp;rdquo;.  I am playing as a part of @blackb6a this time for perfect blue&#39;s annual pbctf. This time there are six crypto challenges and I first blooded ü©∏ half of them. I solved five of them, and collaborated with TWY (who made 99% of the process) for Seed Me.</description>

      <description>Credit. I stole the banner image from the background image of UIUCTF. I like the picture and their unique themes for these two CTFs&amp;hellip;  This is another time @blackb6a unites and plays UIUCTF together. It was my fourth time playing UIUCTF, and I still found the challenges fun. Although the crypto challenges are relatively easy, I had a lot of fun solving phpfuck with @02E774.

      <description>This is me playing another Google CTF with @blackb6a, ending up on the 25th place. I aced the crypto challenges and solved some challenges with my teammates. I have a strong feeling that Black Bauhinia grown a lot between the two Google CTFs and I am often backed by my teammates this time. Anyway, I will be covering all of the crypto challenges in this blog post.

      <description>Recently I am motivated to solve some algorithmic problems. I will be picking five challenges from LeetCode everyday, including three medium and two hard challenges. I expect that I will be spending two hours per day on solving those challenges.
There are some objectives that I want to achieve:
 To think algorithmically again To not rely on the test cases for debugging, nor the hints To write more self-explanatory code To learn (or re-learn) more algorithms To prove my approach is valid if it seems unsound  Additionally, I&#39;ll write blogposts on the problems I dealt.</description>

      <description>I played DEF CON CTF Quals once again with @Shellphish and we ended up at the 10th place. This blog post describes what actually was going on from my side. If you are looking for an informative blog post, this is not a good-read for you. There would be a little useful information, since I am just hanging around most of the time. I will even shamelessly copy some memes online to make the blog post looked rich in content.</description>

      <description>PlaidCTF this year had very insane challenges. Although I have spent a lot of time working on those crypto challenges, I was only able to solve leaky block cipher.
Challenge Summary  This completely legitimate‚Ñ¢ block cipher looks a bit like GCM, but my computer plumber keeps complaining about water residue. Can you help me spot the leak?
 The challenge has a hand-crafted AEAD scheme. We are required to go through 20 rounds of challenges, and this is how each round proceeds:</description>

      <description>I played √•ngstromCTF 2021 for @blackb6a to spend my Easter holiday. I solved most of the reverse and cryptography challenges alone. In particular, Cache Money is one of the harder crypto challenges that I spent more than one day dealing with. It is very rewarding, and eventually four teams ended up solving it.
Challenge Summary This challenge reimplements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) on 128, 192 and 256-bit keys. The encryptor is equipped with caches and we are given a service to encrypt (or decrypt) our messages.</description>

This is actually an article that I begin writing on March 2019, and it never got published&amp;hellip;  It is the [insert an arbitrary number] time I have determined to learn binary exploitation since April 2017. However I have always lost intention as the problems are much more challenging than I am capable of. I could hardly remember anything on the next time when I have determined to study again.</description>

      <description>On August 2020, @blackb6a was invited to co-organize HKCERT CTF 2020 (which is held on November 2020) as one of the challenge authors. This is a CTF for secondary and tertiary students in Hong Kong. Although I had experience preparing CTFs earlier, this is actually the first CTF officially prepared by Black Bauhinia. I have written four challenges for this CTF - Sanity Check II (Web), LF2 (Reverse), Sign In Please (Crypto) and Calm Down (Crypto).</description>

      <description>This time I am playing alone for @blackb6a and had all the crypto challenges solved (and nothing else). I found the crypto challenges in many of the CTFs this year are worth-trying, and these are no exceptions. I ended up at the 9th place. By the way, @SuperGuesser is the first to solve for all of the crypto challenges. Can we nerf @RBTree_ and @rkm0959?
Additionally, phoenix had seven solves and while horcrux and boggart had two.</description>

      <description>Challenge Summary  A committee was formed last year to decide the highly-sensitive contents of the flag for this challenge. Our informant managed to leak some data, but he was arrested within weeks of the committee&#39;s operation. All we have are the logs of the committee&#39;s meetings.

      <description>I was playing Union CTF with @blackb6a last week. Since this CTF is prepared by cr0wn where Jack and hyperreality were in (they made CryptoHack), I am convinced that the CTF will be fun. Turns out I wasn&#39;t disappointed at all. I will be writing three or four posts on the challenges, and the first of the series covers on exah, the reversing challenge I spent most of my time (yet not solving it).</description>

      <description>DiceCTF 2021 had an assortment of challenges and most of them are tough. Although the five crypto challenges which looked unoriginal, I was only able to solve garbled during the contest and I liked the challenges very much. After the CTF, I have found writeups from various sources and learnt a lot. In this writeup, only plagiarism and benaloh will be covered. However, I haven&#39;t look at the remaining questions yet, and they are definitely on my to-do list.</description>

      <description>I was playing justCTF 2020 with the new CTFers in Yakitori (Firebird). Oracles is a fun cryptography challenge that I solved during the game, and I thought this is worth compiling the write-up.
Challenge Summary We are given a chance to ask the agencies for oracles. The challenge author have prepared some questions for us:
 Is Goldbach&#39;s conjecture true? What is the answer to everything?  On top of them, the challenge author tried to tell the agency the flag.</description>

This is a beginning of a new series of blog posts that I review CTF challenges those are not publicly accessible. Generally I will spend some time to solve the challenge while discussing with the author, and give some feedback of the challenge.</description>

Oofbleck (Crypto) One (out of six) team have solved this during the CTF period.
Challenge Summary  Some of the block cipher modes of operation are pretty vulnerable, which includes but not limited to padding oracle in CBC, key-recovery attacks with repeated nonces in GCM and Zerologon in CFB8.</description>

      <description>TetCTF is the first CTF I have played in 2021. I recalled from last year that they have cool challenges. This year, there are three crypto challenges. In particular, unevaluated is the hardest among them. Although I did not solve them, I dug into rabbit holes and had a lot of struggle, uh, fun.
Challenge Summary There is a 128-bit prime $p$. Define $\cdot: \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\times\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2$ by
\[(x_1, y_1)\cdot(x_2, y_2) := \left(\left(x_1x_2-y_1y_2\right)\ \text{mod}\ p^2, \left(x_1y_2+y_1x_2\right)\ \text{mod}\ p^2\right),\]</description>

      <description>I was teamed up to play hxp CTF as @blackb6a last week. The hxp team had come up with a collection of hard challenges. In particular, there are two series of crypto challenges with a total of five parts. I will be writing on the hyper challenge and some follow-up and unanswered questions regarding to hyperelliptic curves.

      <description>Dragon CTF 2020 is definitely had my best CTF moments. There are big brain moments and I have been mind-blown for multiple times during the game. This time we have teamed up with @blackb6a. I have solved all the crypto challenges and two challenges with my teammates.
There are three challenges writeup in this post:

      <description>Rotten Secured Algorithm is the only challenge that I have written for Firebird Intro CTF. Two people (out of 166) ended up solving the challenge.
There is a Python script attached in the challenge, as well as the output file. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on in the Python:

      <description>This week, we have teamed up as @blackb6a to play CONFidence 2020 CTF. We end up ranked 15, but we are more proud of ourselves able to solve a reversing challenge called Team Trees (395 points, 5 solves).
In particular, we are the first-to-solve to the challenge. It took us around two hours to win the flag. This writeup is written by @harrier_lcc and @mystiz613.
Challenge Summary  We wanted to plant a lot of trees, but it&#39;s going kinda slow.</description>

      <description>I was teamed-up with @blackb6a on Google CTF this time. I have solved 7 challenges alone and 3 challenges with my teammates.
In particular, Oracle is a crypto challenge with 13 solves. It has got me spending 12 hours. All in all, it was a great experience in terms of learning, but my liver hurts. This piece of writeup may be very computation intensive, just because I would like to make everything clear.</description>

      <description>Challenge Summary  Tom Nook is testing a new encryption scheme for nookphones, but it seems to be a bit faulty... can you break it?
 nookcrypt is a netcat service that have no source code released. There are two functions exposed:
 Gets an encrypted copy of the flag (and the message hello world). Encrypts an arbitrary message.  For example, this is what I had when trying out the options:</description>

      <description>I was teamed up with @shellphish this time for De1CTF. During the game, I have solved 5 (out of 7) cryptography challenges individually, and a reverse challenge and a misc challenge in cooperation with DuSu and fs0c.
I said that I&#39;ll commit the solution scripts to my Github after I have managed to prettify them. It never happened. I will not make the same promise again.
Homomorphic Challenge Summary This is a cryptography challenge with 465 points.</description>

      <description>It has been a very long time that I&#39;ve compiled a writeup. This time I have played on my own as @blackb6a. Let me write on some particular interesting ideas that I have learnt in the challenges. Bear with me if you find this writeup too math-intensive.
The solution scripts will be committed to my Github repository sooner or later, after I&#39;ve managed to prettify them.
