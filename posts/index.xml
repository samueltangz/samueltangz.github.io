      <description>@blackb6a played Dragon CTF 2021 last weekend and I spent most of the time solving the CRC duo. They are very fun but unfortunately that we were close enough while unable to get the second flag.
Warmup edition only. If you are interested to learn the harder edition that involves a 128-bit CRC, you may want to look at hellman&amp;rsquo;s writeup. I would only cover a solution of the easier edition with some unsuccessful attempts of the harder one.</description>

      <description>@blackb6a played Balsn CTF 2021 last weekend. There are three crypto challenges, and they are all pretty hard. In this blog post we will cover the dlog challenge, which is a timing attack on the CPython&#39;s pow method. @grhkm2023 and I spent a lot of time working on this challenge. Although we did not solve it, we actually learned a lot from the challenge and lost a pile of hair (maybe it is just me).</description>

      <description>Black Bauhinia coorganized HKCERT CTF 2021 and helped 95% of the technical stuffs, including challenge setting, platform development, infrastructure and etc. I will be writing a series of blog posts talking about the contest, and the first four would be the writeups of the challenges those I wrote.
In the first blog post, we will be going through four easier crypto challenges: A Joke Cipher, Cipher Mode Picker, Key Backup Service 1 and Key Backup Service 2.</description>

BSides Ahmedabad CTF 2021 is organized by @zer0pts. That implies that players could spend a day happily working on the challenges. I enjoyed working on the challenges a lot. I&#39;ll go through the harder crypto challenges and the reversing challenge called Collapsed License in this blog post.

      <description>LagLeg is a crypto challenge in ASIS CTF Quals 2021. We are asked to factor a given $n$ with $n = (r^5 + s)(r + s)$ as part of the challenge. Hereby $r$ and $s$ are respectively 256 and 64 bits long. I think my approach used is very unique and creative - and definitely worth mentioning. It does not mean that it is a good approach, however.
I will record the exact steps I solved the challenge.</description>

I am playing as a part of @blackb6a this time for perfect blue&#39;s annual pbctf. This time there are six crypto challenges and I first blooded 🩸 half of them. I solved five of them, and collaborated with TWY (who made 99% of the process) for Seed Me.</description>

I like the picture and their unique themes for these two CTFs&amp;hellip;  This is another time @blackb6a unites and plays UIUCTF together. It was my fourth time playing UIUCTF, and I still found the challenges fun. Although the crypto challenges are relatively easy, I had a lot of fun solving phpfuck with @02E774.

      <description>This is me playing another Google CTF with @blackb6a, ending up on the 25th place. I aced the crypto challenges and solved some challenges with my teammates. I have a strong feeling that Black Bauhinia grown a lot between the two Google CTFs and I am often backed by my teammates this time. Anyway, I will be covering all of the crypto challenges in this blog post.

      <description>Recently I am motivated to solve some algorithmic problems. I will be picking five challenges from LeetCode everyday, including three medium and two hard challenges. I expect that I will be spending two hours per day on solving those challenges.
There are some objectives that I want to achieve:
 To think algorithmically again To not rely on the test cases for debugging, nor the hints To write more self-explanatory code To learn (or re-learn) more algorithms To prove my approach is valid if it seems unsound  Additionally, I&#39;ll write blogposts on the problems I dealt.</description>

If you are looking for an informative blog post, this is not a good-read for you. There would be a little useful information, since I am just hanging around most of the time. I will even shamelessly copy some memes online to make the blog post looked rich in content.</description>

      <description>PlaidCTF this year had very insane challenges. Although I have spent a lot of time working on those crypto challenges, I was only able to solve leaky block cipher.
Challenge Summary  This completely legitimate™ block cipher looks a bit like GCM, but my computer plumber keeps complaining about water residue. Can you help me spot the leak?
 The challenge has a hand-crafted AEAD scheme. We are required to go through 20 rounds of challenges, and this is how each round proceeds:</description>

      <description>I played ångstromCTF 2021 for @blackb6a to spend my Easter holiday. I solved most of the reverse and cryptography challenges alone. In particular, Cache Money is one of the harder crypto challenges that I spent more than one day dealing with. It is very rewarding, and eventually four teams ended up solving it.
Challenge Summary This challenge reimplements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) on 128, 192 and 256-bit keys. The encryptor is equipped with caches and we are given a service to encrypt (or decrypt) our messages.</description>

However I have always lost intention as the problems are much more challenging than I am capable of.

      <description>On August 2020, @blackb6a was invited to co-organize HKCERT CTF 2020 (which is held on November 2020) as one of the challenge authors. This is a CTF for secondary and tertiary students in Hong Kong. Although I had experience preparing CTFs earlier, this is actually the first CTF officially prepared by Black Bauhinia. I have written four challenges for this CTF - Sanity Check II (Web), LF2 (Reverse), Sign In Please (Crypto) and Calm Down (Crypto).</description>

      <description>This time I am playing alone for @blackb6a and had all the crypto challenges solved (and nothing else). I found the crypto challenges in many of the CTFs this year are worth-trying, and these are no exceptions. I ended up at the 9th place. By the way, @SuperGuesser is the first to solve for all of the crypto challenges. Can we nerf @RBTree_ and @rkm0959?
Additionally, phoenix had seven solves and while horcrux and boggart had two.</description>

Since this CTF is prepared by cr0wn where Jack and hyperreality were in (they made CryptoHack), I am convinced that the CTF will be fun. Turns out I wasn&#39;t disappointed at all. I will be writing three or four posts on the challenges, and the first of the series covers on exah, the reversing challenge I spent most of my time (yet not solving it).</description>

      <description>DiceCTF 2021 had an assortment of challenges and most of them are tough. Although the five crypto challenges which looked unoriginal, I was only able to solve garbled during the contest and I liked the challenges very much. After the CTF, I have found writeups from various sources and learnt a lot. In this writeup, only plagiarism and benaloh will be covered. However, I haven&#39;t look at the remaining questions yet, and they are definitely on my to-do list.</description>

      <description>I was playing justCTF 2020 with the new CTFers in Yakitori (Firebird). Oracles is a fun cryptography challenge that I solved during the game, and I thought this is worth compiling the write-up.
Challenge Summary We are given a chance to ask the agencies for oracles. The challenge author have prepared some questions for us:
 Is Goldbach&#39;s conjecture true? What is the answer to everything?  On top of them, the challenge author tried to tell the agency the flag.</description>

      <description>I have written four question for Firebird Internal CTF - Oofbleck (Crypto), Obvious Transfer (Crypto), RC4 (Misc) and Prooof-ooof-Wooork (Reverse, Misc). I will be including all of them in this blog post.
Oofbleck (Crypto) One (out of six) team have solved this during the CTF period.
Challenge Summary  Some of the block cipher modes of operation are pretty vulnerable, which includes but not limited to padding oracle in CBC, key-recovery attacks with repeated nonces in GCM and Zerologon in CFB8.</description>

      <description>TetCTF is the first CTF I have played in 2021. I recalled from last year that they have cool challenges. This year, there are three crypto challenges. In particular, unevaluated is the hardest among them. Although I did not solve them, I dug into rabbit holes and had a lot of struggle, uh, fun.
Challenge Summary There is a 128-bit prime $p$. Define $\cdot: \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\times\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2$ by
\[(x_1, y_1)\cdot(x_2, y_2) := \left(\left(x_1x_2-y_1y_2\right)\ \text{mod}\ p^2, \left(x_1y_2+y_1x_2\right)\ \text{mod}\ p^2\right),\]</description>

      <description>I was teamed up to play hxp CTF as @blackb6a last week. The hxp team had come up with a collection of hard challenges. In particular, there are two series of crypto challenges with a total of five parts. I will be writing on the hyper challenge and some follow-up and unanswered questions regarding to hyperelliptic curves.

Seriously. I knew nothing on hyperelliptic curves prior to the CTF.</description>

      <description>Written from the perspective of Mystiz. babykok writeup by GeoffreyY.  Dragon CTF 2020 is definitely had my best CTF moments. There are big brain moments and I have been mind-blown for multiple times during the game. This time we have teamed up with @blackb6a. I have solved all the crypto challenges and two challenges with my teammates.
There are three challenges writeup in this post:
 Bit Flip (parts 2 and 3) Frying in motion babykok  Bit Flip (Crypto, 155+324+343 points) Challenge Summary At the beginning, a 128-bit alice_secret (denoted as $a$) is generated.</description>

      <description>Rotten Secured Algorithm is the only challenge that I have written for Firebird Intro CTF. Two people (out of 166) ended up solving the challenge.
There is a Python script attached in the challenge, as well as the output file. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on in the Python:

      <description>This week, we have teamed up as @blackb6a to play CONFidence 2020 CTF. We end up ranked 15, but we are more proud of ourselves able to solve a reversing challenge called Team Trees (395 points, 5 solves).
In particular, we are the first-to-solve to the challenge. It took us around two hours to win the flag. This writeup is written by @harrier_lcc and @mystiz613.
Challenge Summary  We wanted to plant a lot of trees, but it&#39;s going kinda slow.</description>

      <description>I was teamed-up with @blackb6a on Google CTF this time. I have solved 7 challenges alone and 3 challenges with my teammates.
In particular, Oracle is a crypto challenge with 13 solves. It has got me spending 12 hours. All in all, it was a great experience in terms of learning, but my liver hurts. This piece of writeup may be very computation intensive, just because I would like to make everything clear.</description>

      <description>Challenge Summary  Tom Nook is testing a new encryption scheme for nookphones, but it seems to be a bit faulty... can you break it?
 nookcrypt is a netcat service that have no source code released. There are two functions exposed:
 Gets an encrypted copy of the flag (and the message hello world). Encrypts an arbitrary message.  For example, this is what I had when trying out the options:</description>

      <description>I was teamed up with @shellphish this time for De1CTF. During the game, I have solved 5 (out of 7) cryptography challenges individually, and a reverse challenge and a misc challenge in cooperation with DuSu and fs0c.
I said that I&#39;ll commit the solution scripts to my Github after I have managed to prettify them. It never happened. I will not make the same promise again.
Homomorphic Challenge Summary This is a cryptography challenge with 465 points.</description>

      <description>It has been a very long time that I&#39;ve compiled a writeup. This time I have played on my own as @blackb6a. Let me write on some particular interesting ideas that I have learnt in the challenges. Bear with me if you find this writeup too math-intensive.
The solution scripts will be committed to my Github repository sooner or later, after I&#39;ve managed to prettify them.
Babylfsr (Crypto, 338 points) This is an easy challenge.</description>
