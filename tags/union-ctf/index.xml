      <description>Challenge Summary  A committee was formed last year to decide the highly-sensitive contents of the flag for this challenge. Our informant managed to leak some data, but he was arrested within weeks of the committee&#39;s operation. All we have are the logs of the committee&#39;s meetings.

      <description>I was playing Union CTF with @blackb6a last week. Since this CTF is prepared by cr0wn where Jack and hyperreality were in (they made CryptoHack), I am convinced that the CTF will be fun. Turns out I wasn&#39;t disappointed at all. I will be writing three or four posts on the challenges, and the first of the series covers on exah, the reversing challenge I spent most of my time (yet not solving it).</description>
