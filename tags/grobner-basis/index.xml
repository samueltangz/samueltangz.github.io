      <description>&lt;p&gt;DiceCTF 2021 had an assortment of challenges and most of them are tough. Although the five crypto challenges which looked unoriginal, I was only able to solve &lt;em&gt;garbled&lt;/em&gt; during the contest and I liked the challenges very much. After the CTF, I have found writeups from various sources and learnt a lot. In this writeup, only &lt;em&gt;plagiarism&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;benaloh&lt;/em&gt; will be covered. However, I haven&#39;t look at the remaining questions yet, and they are definitely on my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
