      <description>DiceCTF is an annual CTF competition prepared by @dicegangctf. The challenges are great and we had a lot of fun solving them. I might be compiling writeup for a number of them, which depends if I had time.
Deja vu? I said similar things last year. Until now, part 2 of my writeup series on DiceCTF 2021 does not exist.  I will first cover on a crypto challenge called commitment-issues, which had 16 solves (out of 1127 participating teams).</description>

      <description>DiceCTF 2021 had an assortment of challenges and most of them are tough. Although the five crypto challenges which looked unoriginal, I was only able to solve garbled during the contest and I liked the challenges very much. After the CTF, I have found writeups from various sources and learnt a lot. In this writeup, only plagiarism and benaloh will be covered. However, I haven&#39;t look at the remaining questions yet, and they are definitely on my to-do list.</description>
