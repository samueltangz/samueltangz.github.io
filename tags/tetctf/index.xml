      <description>TetCTF comes back with their great crypto challenges. I played with @blackb6a and we ended up securing the ðŸ¥‰ third place. In this blog post, I will walk through adapt, a challenge which required us to make fake proofs in an IAVL tree implementation. There are only three solves during the contest period.
Challenge Summary We are started with an empty immutable AVL (IAVL) tree every connection. We can send up to 2024 messages and it will store the key-value pair (message, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;) to the tree.</description>

      <description>TetCTF is the first CTF I have played in 2021. I recalled from last year that they have cool challenges. This year, there are three crypto challenges. In particular, unevaluated is the hardest among them. Although I did not solve them, I dug into rabbit holes and had a lot of struggle, uh, fun.
Challenge Summary There is a 128-bit prime $p$. Define $\cdot: \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\times\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2$ by
\[(x_1, y_1)\cdot(x_2, y_2) := \left(\left(x_1x_2-y_1y_2\right)\ \text{mod}\ p^2, \left(x_1y_2+y_1x_2\right)\ \text{mod}\ p^2\right),\]</description>
