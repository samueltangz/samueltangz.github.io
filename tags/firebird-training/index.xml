      <description>Like in 2021 and 2022, I contributed some challenges for Firebird&amp;rsquo;s internal CTF, which are from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. This time I wrote three crypto challenges: Randomsum, Shelter and Threerider.
There were 24 teams participating. There were three solves for Randomsum, while Shelter and Threerider were unsolved during the CTF.
Randomsum Challenge Summary  I am leaking random bits of the RSA factors. Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like leaks?</description>

      <description>This is the time that Firebird Internal CTF happens. I made three crypto challenges this year - Lack of Entropy (⭐), Authenticator (⭐⭐) and Collider (⭐⭐). I will discuss the solution for all of them in the blog post.
What are the stars? They are the difficulties I estimated when comparing to global CTFs (where I documented them here since Q3 last year).  Lack of Entropy (Crypto) Three (out of six) teams solved this during the CTF.</description>

      <description>I have written four question for Firebird Internal CTF - Oofbleck (Crypto), Obvious Transfer (Crypto), RC4 (Misc) and Prooof-ooof-Wooork (Reverse, Misc). I will be including all of them in this blog post.
Oofbleck (Crypto) One (out of six) team have solved this during the CTF period.
Challenge Summary  Some of the block cipher modes of operation are pretty vulnerable, which includes but not limited to padding oracle in CBC, key-recovery attacks with repeated nonces in GCM and Zerologon in CFB8.</description>

      <description>Rotten Secured Algorithm is the only challenge that I have written for Firebird Intro CTF. Two people (out of 166) ended up solving the challenge.
There is a Python script attached in the challenge, as well as the output file. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on in the Python:
