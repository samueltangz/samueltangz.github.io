      <description>DiceCTF is an annual CTF competition prepared by @dicegangctf. The challenges are great and we had a lot of fun solving them. I might be compiling writeup for a number of them, which depends if I had time.
Deja vu? I said similar things last year. Until now, part 2 of my writeup series on DiceCTF 2021 does not exist.  I will first cover on a crypto challenge called commitment-issues, which had 16 solves (out of 1127 participating teams).</description>

      <description>I was playing justCTF 2020 with the new CTFers in Yakitori (Firebird). Oracles is a fun cryptography challenge that I solved during the game, and I thought this is worth compiling the write-up.
Challenge Summary We are given a chance to ask the agencies for oracles. The challenge author have prepared some questions for us:
 Is Goldbach&#39;s conjecture true? What is the answer to everything?  On top of them, the challenge author tried to tell the agency the flag.</description>
