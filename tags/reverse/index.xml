      <description>We will finally cover the non-crypto challenges that I wrote for HKCERT CTF 2023. This includes one misc (Hackforces), two pwn (ISA Jump Scare &amp;amp; ISA Jogger) and two reverse (The Flag Game &amp;amp; Loot and Scoot) challenges.
Hackforces Challenge Summary  Do you know Codeforces? Well, what you need is to find a corner case to make the given submission not work.
Attachment: hackforces.zip
 We are given an introductory competitive programming problem (equivalent to Unique Paths II in LeetCode) with its solution implemented in C.</description>

在意的 不再是 愛的煩惱
是哪樣做人 更清高
餘生那段旅途
與哪類人共舞

      <description>I was playing Union CTF with @blackb6a last week. Since this CTF is prepared by cr0wn where Jack and hyperreality were in (they made CryptoHack), I am convinced that the CTF will be fun. Turns out I wasn&#39;t disappointed at all. I will be writing three or four posts on the challenges, and the first of the series covers on exah, the reversing challenge I spent most of my time (yet not solving it).</description>

      <description>This week, we have teamed up as @blackb6a to play CONFidence 2020 CTF. We end up ranked 15, but we are more proud of ourselves able to solve a reversing challenge called Team Trees (395 points, 5 solves).
In particular, we are the first-to-solve to the challenge. It took us around two hours to win the flag. This writeup is written by @harrier_lcc and @mystiz613.
Challenge Summary  We wanted to plant a lot of trees, but it&#39;s going kinda slow.</description>
