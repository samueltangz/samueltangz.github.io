      <description>I was teamed up with @shellphish this time for De1CTF. During the game, I have solved 5 (out of 7) cryptography challenges individually, and a reverse challenge and a misc challenge in cooperation with DuSu and fs0c.
I said that I&#39;ll commit the solution scripts to my Github after I have managed to prettify them. It never happened. I will not make the same promise again.
Homomorphic Challenge Summary This is a cryptography challenge with 465 points.</description>

      <description>It has been a very long time that I&#39;ve compiled a writeup. This time I have played on my own as @blackb6a. Let me write on some particular interesting ideas that I have learnt in the challenges. Bear with me if you find this writeup too math-intensive.
The solution scripts will be committed to my Github repository sooner or later, after I&#39;ve managed to prettify them.
