      <description>Credits. Thumbnail credit goes to Quasar! ðŸŽ‰  vss is an interesting crypto challenge in BalsnCTF, which ended up having 9 solves. I took around 2.5 hours to solve the challenge. This challenge reminds me the yet another PRNG challenge from pbctf 2021 (challenge description, writeup written by @maple3142 and @rkm0959), but with a setting which looked harder. I was pretty surprised that LLL worked, too.
lfsr is another crypto challenge in BalsnCTF with 6 solvers.</description>

      <description>It has been a very long time that I&#39;ve compiled a writeup. This time I have played on my own as @blackb6a. Let me write on some particular interesting ideas that I have learnt in the challenges. Bear with me if you find this writeup too math-intensive.
The solution scripts will be committed to my Github repository sooner or later, after I&#39;ve managed to prettify them.
Babylfsr (Crypto, 338Â points) This is an easy challenge.</description>
