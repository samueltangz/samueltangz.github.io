      <description>Signature is a crypto challenge from TSJ CTF 2022, which ended up having two solves. From this challenge, we can see how ECDSA private keys can be recovered by having a (weak) deterministic ephemeral key, $k$.
Challenge Summary Suppose that $d$ is the private key for ECDSA (over curve secp256k1). We are given six signatures signed with the above private key. However, $k$ is computed by $k = d \oplus z$ ($z$ is the hash of the message) rather than generated randomly.</description>
