      <description>MHK2 is one of the challenges I coauthored for Google CTF 2023 and there were 20 teams solving this challenge during the contest time.
Challenge Summary This challenge implements the knapsack cryptosystem from Y. Murakami, S. Hamasho and M. Kasahara&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;A knapsack public-key cryptosystem using two random sequences&amp;rdquo;. Below summarizes how a keypair is generated and how a bit is being encrypted:
Generating a keypair  For $i = 1, 2$:  Generate a random sequence $\textbf{s}_i = (s_{i, 1}, s_{i, 2}, &amp;hellip;, s_{i, 256})$ where $0 \leq s_{ij} &amp;lt; 2^{128}$.</description>

      <description>HACKING GOOGLE is a documentary of Google&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity teams and H4CK1NG G00GL3 is it&amp;rsquo;s CTF counterpart. Project Zero Adventure is a cryptography challenge I wrote.
In the game, the players control the Security Princess to dodge the obstacles and catch the bugs (a variant of Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s dinosaur game). After that, the server will sign messages consisting of the players&#39; name and the score via the /sign API. The players will then submit it to the /highscore API.</description>

      <description>This is the third year I had a writeup on Google CTF (see my writeup in 2020 and 2021). Yet this time it is the official writeup for a challenge - as the challenge author! There are eventually 35 solvers (out of 382 teams) for the challenge.
Challenge Summary We are given a public key of Paillier cryptosystem $(n, g)$, and is asked to complete 16 rounds of challenge $\mathcal{C}$. In each round of $\mathcal{C}$:</description>

      <description>This is me playing another Google CTF with @blackb6a, ending up on the 25th place. I aced the crypto challenges and solved some challenges with my teammates. I have a strong feeling that Black Bauhinia grown a lot between the two Google CTFs and I am often backed by my teammates this time. Anyway, I will be covering all of the crypto challenges in this blog post.
H1 Challenge Summary  Crypto is not real hacking, they say.</description>

      <title>Google CTF 2020: Oracle</title>

      <description>I was teamed-up with @blackb6a on Google CTF this time. I have solved 7 challenges alone and 3 challenges with my teammates.
In particular, Oracle is a crypto challenge with 13 solves. It has got me spending 12 hours. All in all, it was a great experience in terms of learning, but my liver hurts. This piece of writeup may be very computation intensive, just because I would like to make everything clear.</description>
