      <description>Credits. Thumbnail credit goes to Quasar! ðŸŽ‰  vss is an interesting crypto challenge in BalsnCTF, which ended up having 9 solves. I took around 2.5 hours to solve the challenge. This challenge reminds me the yet another PRNG challenge from pbctf 2021 (challenge description, writeup written by @maple3142 and @rkm0959), but with a setting which looked harder. I was pretty surprised that LLL worked, too.
lfsr is another crypto challenge in BalsnCTF with 6 solvers.</description>

      <description>@blackb6a played Balsn CTF 2021 last weekend. There are three crypto challenges, and they are all pretty hard. In this blog post we will cover the dlog challenge, which is a timing attack on the CPython&#39;s pow method. @grhkm2023 and I spent a lot of time working on this challenge. Although we did not solve it, we actually learned a lot from the challenge and lost a pile of hair (maybe it is just me).</description>
