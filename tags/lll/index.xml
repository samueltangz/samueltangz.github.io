      <description>Credits. Thumbnail credit goes to Quasar! ðŸŽ‰  vss is an interesting crypto challenge in BalsnCTF, which ended up having 9 solves. I took around 2.5 hours to solve the challenge. This challenge reminds me the yet another PRNG challenge from pbctf 2021 (challenge description, writeup written by @maple3142 and @rkm0959), but with a setting which looked harder. I was pretty surprised that LLL worked, too.
lfsr is another crypto challenge in BalsnCTF with 6 solvers.</description>

      <description>DiceCTF is an annual CTF competition prepared by @dicegangctf. The challenges are great and we had a lot of fun solving them. I might be compiling writeup for a number of them, which depends if I had time.
Deja vu? I said similar things last year. Until now, part 2 of my writeup series on DiceCTF 2021 does not exist.  I will first cover on a crypto challenge called commitment-issues, which had 16 solves (out of 1127 participating teams).</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the thumbnail? I sent it to rbtree after I sent him my solution on Yet Another PRNG and he responded &amp;ldquo;oh this works?&amp;rdquo;.  I am playing as a part of @blackb6a this time for perfect blue&#39;s annual pbctf. This time there are six crypto challenges and I first blooded ðŸ©¸ half of them. I solved five of them, and collaborated with TWY (who made 99% of the process) for Seed Me.</description>
