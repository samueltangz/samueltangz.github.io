      <description>Like in 2021 and 2022, I contributed some challenges for Firebird&amp;rsquo;s internal CTF, which are from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. This time I wrote three crypto challenges: Randomsum, Shelter and Threerider.
There were 24 teams participating. There were three solves for Randomsum, while Shelter and Threerider were unsolved during the CTF.
Randomsum Challenge Summary  I am leaking random bits of the RSA factors. Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like leaks?</description>

      <description>In the last part, I will include the two non-crypto challenges I wrote for HKCERT CTF 2022: Numbers go brrr and Minecraft geoguessr.
​觀塘海濱音樂噴泉 / Numbers go brrr (Reverse) Challenge Summary  This program is generating 100 sets of random numbers and they are asking me to send something back, in exchange for a flag. Can you figure out how to get them through?
 There is a nc service, and we will be given some numbers upon connecting.</description>

      <description>✨ Regarding the thumbnail. This is my Discord avatar combined with Komi from the anime Komi can&amp;rsquo;t communicate, where the challenge Mystiz can&amp;rsquo;t code is referred to. Made by @byronwai.  We will continue walking through the remaining crypto challenges I wrote for HKCERT CTF 2022: Mystiz can&#39;t code, Slow keystream and King of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

      <description>This is the third year Black Bauhinia co-organized HKCERT CTF. This time I wrote nine challenges: Seven crypto, one reverse and one misc.
Similar to the last year, I have a series of three blog posts walking through the challenges that I wrote. We will discuss the four easier crypto challenges: Flawed ElGamal, Catch-22, Rogue Secret Assistant and Base64 encryption.
This is an index of the challenges I wrote for HKCERT CTF 2022.</description>

      <description>HACKING GOOGLE is a documentary of Google&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity teams and H4CK1NG G00GL3 is it&amp;rsquo;s CTF counterpart. Project Zero Adventure is a cryptography challenge I wrote.
In the game, the players control the Security Princess to dodge the obstacles and catch the bugs (a variant of Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s dinosaur game). After that, the server will sign messages consisting of the players&#39; name and the score via the /sign API. The players will then submit it to the /highscore API.</description>

      <description>This is the third year I had a writeup on Google CTF (see my writeup in 2020 and 2021). Yet this time it is the official writeup for a challenge - as the challenge author! There are eventually 35 solvers (out of 382 teams) for the challenge.
Challenge Summary We are given a public key of Paillier cryptosystem $(n, g)$, and is asked to complete 16 rounds of challenge $\mathcal{C}$. In each round of $\mathcal{C}$:</description>

      <description>@blackb6a helped preparing some challenges for MOCSCTF, a 8.5-hour long CTF in Macau. This time I wrote nine challenges and @hoifanrd made one of them (3-AES). This blog post covers the intended solution for all of them.
These are the summary of the challenges:
   Challenge Name Category Solves     RSA Trio Crypto 2/43   Slightly Informative Crypto 2/43   NP-SHA256 Crypto 1/43   HMAC-SHA256 Crypto 2/43   RC4 Crypto 0/43   HashTable Misc 3/43   Wordle Crypto, Misc 0/43   3-AES Crypto, Misc 0/43   Elementary Reverse 0/43   Redactor Reverse 1/43    RSA Trio (Crypto) Challenge Summary When connected to the server, three 1024-bit primes $p$, $q$ and $r$ are generated.</description>

      <description>This is the time that Firebird Internal CTF happens. I made three crypto challenges this year - Lack of Entropy (⭐), Authenticator (⭐⭐) and Collider (⭐⭐). I will discuss the solution for all of them in the blog post.
What are the stars? They are the difficulties I estimated when comparing to global CTFs (where I documented them here since Q3 last year).  Lack of Entropy (Crypto) Three (out of six) teams solved this during the CTF.</description>

      <description>In this part, three harder crypto challenges will be covered: Tenet: The Plagarism, Sratslla SEA and Sign in Please, Again.
FreeRider / Tenet: The Plagarism (Crypto) Challenge Summary  平日我又講 對住你講
email要check deadline要追
前日我提咗 你嗰part嘅功課
點解變咗我最立糯
The deadline for writing challenges is coming!
Mystiz, who claimed himself not well-known reusing challenges, decided to free-ride and plagarize challenges from HKCERT CTF 2020. Maybe you can reuse the solve script last year for the flag.</description>

      <description>Black Bauhinia coorganized HKCERT CTF 2021 and helped 95% of the technical stuffs, including challenge setting, platform development, infrastructure and etc. I will be writing a series of blog posts talking about the contest, and the first four would be the writeups of the challenges those I wrote.
In the first blog post, we will be going through four easier crypto challenges: A Joke Cipher, Cipher Mode Picker, Key Backup Service 1 and Key Backup Service 2.</description>

      <description>On August 2020, @blackb6a was invited to co-organize HKCERT CTF 2020 (which is held on November 2020) as one of the challenge authors. This is a CTF for secondary and tertiary students in Hong Kong. Although I had experience preparing CTFs earlier, this is actually the first CTF officially prepared by Black Bauhinia. I have written four challenges for this CTF - Sanity Check II (Web), LF2 (Reverse), Sign In Please (Crypto) and Calm Down (Crypto).</description>

      <description>There are a lot of moments which I telepathed and synced with the challenge author. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to you, just bear with it.  This is a beginning of a new series of blog posts that I review CTF challenges those are not publicly accessible. Generally I will spend some time to solve the challenge while discussing with the author, and give some feedback of the challenge.</description>

      <description>I have written four question for Firebird Internal CTF - Oofbleck (Crypto), Obvious Transfer (Crypto), RC4 (Misc) and Prooof-ooof-Wooork (Reverse, Misc). I will be including all of them in this blog post.
Oofbleck (Crypto) One (out of six) team have solved this during the CTF period.
Challenge Summary  Some of the block cipher modes of operation are pretty vulnerable, which includes but not limited to padding oracle in CBC, key-recovery attacks with repeated nonces in GCM and Zerologon in CFB8.</description>

      <description>Rotten Secured Algorithm is the only challenge that I have written for Firebird Intro CTF. Two people (out of 166) ended up solving the challenge.
There is a Python script attached in the challenge, as well as the output file. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on in the Python:
