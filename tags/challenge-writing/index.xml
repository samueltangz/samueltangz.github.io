      <description>This is the time that Firebird Internal CTF happens. I made three crypto challenges this year - Lack of Entropy (⭐), Authenticator (⭐⭐) and Collider (⭐⭐). I will discuss the solution for all of them in the blog post.
What are the stars? They are the difficulties I estimated when comparing to global CTFs (where I documented them here since Q3 last year).  Lack of Entropy (Crypto) Three (out of six) teams solved this during the CTF.</description>

The deadline for writing challenges is coming!
Mystiz, who claimed himself not well-known reusing challenges, decided to free-ride and plagarize challenges from HKCERT CTF 2020. Maybe you can reuse the solve script last year for the flag.</description>

      <description>Black Bauhinia coorganized HKCERT CTF 2021 and helped 95% of the technical stuffs, including challenge setting, platform development, infrastructure and etc. I will be writing a series of blog posts talking about the contest, and the first four would be the writeups of the challenges those I wrote.
In the first blog post, we will be going through four easier crypto challenges: A Joke Cipher, Cipher Mode Picker, Key Backup Service 1 and Key Backup Service 2.</description>

      <description>On August 2020, @blackb6a was invited to co-organize HKCERT CTF 2020 (which is held on November 2020) as one of the challenge authors. This is a CTF for secondary and tertiary students in Hong Kong. Although I had experience preparing CTFs earlier, this is actually the first CTF officially prepared by Black Bauhinia. I have written four challenges for this CTF - Sanity Check II (Web), LF2 (Reverse), Sign In Please (Crypto) and Calm Down (Crypto).</description>

      <description>There are a lot of moments which I telepathed and synced with the challenge author. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to you, just bear with it.  This is a beginning of a new series of blog posts that I review CTF challenges those are not publicly accessible. Generally I will spend some time to solve the challenge while discussing with the author, and give some feedback of the challenge.</description>

      <description>I have written four question for Firebird Internal CTF - Oofbleck (Crypto), Obvious Transfer (Crypto), RC4 (Misc) and Prooof-ooof-Wooork (Reverse, Misc). I will be including all of them in this blog post.
Oofbleck (Crypto) One (out of six) team have solved this during the CTF period.
Challenge Summary  Some of the block cipher modes of operation are pretty vulnerable, which includes but not limited to padding oracle in CBC, key-recovery attacks with repeated nonces in GCM and Zerologon in CFB8.</description>

      <description>Rotten Secured Algorithm is the only challenge that I have written for Firebird Intro CTF. Two people (out of 166) ended up solving the challenge.
There is a Python script attached in the challenge, as well as the output file. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on in the Python:
