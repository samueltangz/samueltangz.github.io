      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time flies. A week passed in the blink of an eye, and another month has passed with another blink... and here comes the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;capture-the-flag&#34;&gt;Capture-the-Flag&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I played much less CTFs since the middle of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I often thought that I was sticking to much with Black Bauhinia, and I had intense feeling to join the other teams this year. I played with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thehackerscrew1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;@thehackerscrew1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DeFiHackLabs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;@DeFiHackLabs&lt;/a&gt; as a guest player for various CTFs. I did not regret this at all - this opened up some opportunities to collaborate and meet with different people. I am mentally more stable, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ups and downs for in 2023. There were some joyful gatherings and reunions, but at the same time, things did go very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite my reluctance travelling back to Hong Kong, I was motivated enough and went back twice in January and June. Owing to various reasons, it is much harder for me to see the people I care if I couldn&#39;t meet them in time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;alert info&#34;&gt;&#xA;  💭 &lt;strong&gt;Is this technical?&lt;/strong&gt; No. If you are looking for CTF writeups, this is not what you are interested. Instead, this is just me talking on my 2022.&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2022 is a life-changer for me. There were some tough decisions and a few surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;leaving-hong-kong&#34;&gt;Leaving Hong Kong&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmVtpXz1AL4?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The #1 difference for me is I moved from Hong Kong &amp;#x1f1ed;&amp;#x1f1f0; to Taiwan &amp;#x1f1f9;&amp;#x1f1fc;. The most obvious reason is to commence my new career at Google, which I think was an opportunity as well. Back in May 2021, I was contacted by recruiters from Google to see if I am interested in working there. I always have low self-esteem, so I could never imagine passing the interviews and getting the offer. Well, as most of you know, I passed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
