      <description>Asian Cyber Security Challenge (ACSC) is an annual CTF where players are competing individually, and the best young Asians will be selected form a team to represent Asia to compete with others. I ended up winning the competition among 450+ players. Unfortunately, I am unable to qualify because of the age and nationality conditions.
In this blog post, I will cover two web challenges, @t0nk42&amp;rsquo;s easySSTI (43 solves) and @tyage&amp;rsquo;s Gotion (9 solves).</description>

      <description>I played ångstromCTF 2021 for @blackb6a to spend my Easter holiday. I solved most of the reverse and cryptography challenges alone. In particular, Cache Money is one of the harder crypto challenges that I spent more than one day dealing with. It is very rewarding, and eventually four teams ended up solving it.
Challenge Summary This challenge reimplements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) on 128, 192 and 256-bit keys. The encryptor is equipped with caches and we are given a service to encrypt (or decrypt) our messages.</description>
