      <description>Credit. I stole the banner image from the background image of UIUCTF. I like the picture and their unique themes for these two CTFs&amp;hellip;  This is another time @blackb6a unites and plays UIUCTF together. It was my fourth time playing UIUCTF, and I still found the challenges fun. Although the crypto challenges are relatively easy, I had a lot of fun solving phpfuck with @02E774.
