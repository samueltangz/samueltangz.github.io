      <description>Preface Warning. This is actually an article that I begin writing on March 2019, and it never got published&amp;hellip;  It is the [insert an arbitrary number] time I have determined to learn binary exploitation since April 2017. However I have always lost intention as the problems are much more challenging than I am capable of. I could hardly remember anything on the next time when I have determined to study again.</description>
