      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;alert warning&#34;&gt;&#xA;  This was actually an article that I begin writing on March 2019, and it never got published...&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the [&lt;em&gt;insert an arbitrary number&lt;/em&gt;] time I have determined to learn binary exploitation since April 2017. However I have always lost intention as the problems are much more challenging than I am capable of. I could hardly remember anything on the next time when I have determined to study again. That&#39;s an incentive for me to write blog posts - I could read them and recall what has happened, thus spending less time learning all over from zero. Of course, it would be always better if I could persist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
